# Deploy Azure Data Platform End2End to your subscription

In this section you will automatically provision all Azure resources required to complete labs 1 though to 5. We will use a pre-defined ARM template with the definition of all Azure services used to ingest, store, process and visualise data. 

## Azure services provisioned for the workshop

The following Azure services will be deployed in your subscription:

 <br>**IMPORTANT**: When you deploy the lab resources in your own subscription you are responsible for the charges related to the use of the services provisioned. If you don't want any extra charges associated with the lab resources you should delete the lab resource group and all resources in it.

The estimated time to complete this lab is: 30 minutes.

## Prepare your Azure subscription
In this section you will use the Azure Portal to create a Resource Group that will host the Azure Data Services used in labs 1 through to 5.

**IMPORTANT**|

8.	In the Region drop down list, select one of the regions from the list below.

    **IMPORTANT**: The ARM template you will use to deploy the lab components uses the Resource Group region as the default region for all services. To avoid deployment errors when services are not available in the region selected, please use one of the recommended regions in the list below.

    Recommended Regions|

## Deploy Azure Services
In this section you will use automated deployment and ARM templates to automate the deployment of all Azure Data Services used in labs 1 through to 5.

1. You can deploy all Azure services required in each lab by clicking the **Deploy to Azure** button below. 

    <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FCDAC-lab%2FBUS5WB-Azure-Workshop-3%2Fmaster%2FDeploy%2Fazuredeploy.json" target="_blank">
    <img src="./Media/deploytoazure.png"/>    
</a>

2. You will be directed to the Azure portal to deploy the ADPE2E ARM template from this repository. On the **Custom deployment** blade, enter the following details:
    <br>- **Subscription**: [your Azure subscription]

## Workshop cost management

Some of the services still incur costs even when not running. If you don't want any extra charges associated with the lab resources you should delete the lab resource group and all resources in it.
